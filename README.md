# Fast Aleck [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ddfreyne/fast-aleck.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ddfreyne/fast-aleck)

Fast Aleck is a tool for making text look smarter by using proper Unicode characters. For example, ... becomes … (`&hellip;`) and -- becomes — (`&mdash;`). Its goal is to be the fastest text cleaning tool out there. It is HTML-aware and also supports UTF-8.

Status
------

Fast Aleck is **alpha quality**. Expect things to break. If it breaks, please do let me know! Crash reports and examples of incorrect output are *greatly* appreciated!

How fast is it really?
----------------------

Here are the results of a benchmark in which a copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is typographically enhanced 5000 times (see ruby/bench.rb):

	Rubypants                   2min 15.77s
	Typogruby                  50min 23.29s
	Fast Aleck (all options)         10.75s
	Fast Aleck (no options)           9.30s

As you can see, Fast Aleck is over 10 times as fast as Rubypants and about 300x as fast as Typogruby.

Features
--------

* ... → …
* -- → —
* --- → —
* '' → ‘’
* "" → “”
* Skips text inside `code`, `kbd`, `pre` and `script` elements
* Optionally wraps `&amp;` in `<span class="amp">` so you can pick the font with the prettiest ampersand
* Optionally wraps `'` in a span with class `quo`
* Optionally wraps `"` in a span with class `dquo`
* Optionally replaces last significant whitespace in a block with a non-breaking space (Widon’t)
* Optionally wraps sequences of capitals in `<span class="caps">` so you can use small caps.

Example input:

	This... CANNOT be true--it's impossible! "I had five EC2 instances!"

Example output:

	This… <span class="caps">CANNOT</span> be true—it’s impossible! “I had five <span class="caps">EC2</span>&nbsp;instances!”

Installation
------------

Building Fast Aleck requires CMake. Once you have that:

	% mkdir build
	% cd build
	% cmake ..
	% make

There will be three executables in the build directory once that is finished:

* `fast-aleck` is the commandline tool (try `fast-aleck --help` for help)
* `libfast-aleck.so` is the shared library (the exact name might differ depending on the OS)
* `fast-aleck-test` is a tool that runs the tests

If you intend to use the Ruby bindings, copy `libfast-aleck.so` to a public location (such as `/usr/local/lib`) or into the directory where you are executing Ruby from. For instance, if you want to use Fast Aleck with nanoc, you can copy `libfast-aleck.so` into the site directory (not in `./lib`).
